## JSON Web Token (JWT)
UniHub API uses JSON Web Token (JWT) to implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms. 
JWT is a standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

Implementation of JWT includes the following steps:
1. User Authentication: When a user logs in, the app verifies the user's email address and password. If the user's credentials are valid, the app generates a JWT and returns it to the user.
2. JWT structure: The JWT includes three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header contains information about the algorithm used to sign the token, the payload contains the user's ID and role, and the signature is used to verify the authenticity of the token.
3. Authorization: UniHub uses role-based access control to control access to the app's features and data. When a user makes a request to the app's API, the app verifies the JWT included in the request. If the JWT is valid and contains the appropriate role, the app grants access to the requested feature or data.
